# docker-library

Library of Docker images that I build and use

-   [Minimal](./Minimal/README.md): A minimal example of being able to build a docker image while also being able to do local development.
-   Hugo static site generator:
    -   [Hugo/base](./Hugo/base/README.md): A good starting point for running a new Hugo site inside of a container.
    -   [Hugo/tailwindcss](./Hugo/tailwindcss/README.md): With TailwindCSS support.
